                <h2>The Green Jobs Opportunity</h2>
                <p>
                  Nigeria's energy transition presents an unprecedented opportunity to address two critical challenges
                  simultaneously: climate change and unemployment. With youth unemployment rates exceeding 40% and the
                  urgent need to decarbonize the economy, the clean energy sector emerges as a powerful solution that
                  can create millions of quality jobs while building a sustainable future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This comprehensive analysis by YCTF's Energy Programme reveals that Nigeria can create 2 million green
                  jobs by 2030 through strategic investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and grid
                  modernization. These jobs span the entire value chain, from manufacturing and installation to
                  operation and maintenance, offering opportunities for workers across all skill levels.
                </p>

                <h2>Current Employment Landscape</h2>
                <p>
                  Nigeria's energy sector currently employs approximately 300,000 people, with the majority working in
                  oil and gas operations. The renewable energy sector, while growing rapidly, employs fewer than 50,000
                  people directly. This represents a massive untapped potential for job creation as the country
                  transitions to clean energy.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Nigeria's energy transition presents a historic opportunity to create 2 million quality green jobs by
                  2030. This transformation will not only address the country's unemployment challenge but also position
                  Nigeria as a leader in Africa's clean energy future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Success requires coordinated action from government, private sector, and development partners.
                  Investment in skills development, supportive policies, and strategic industrial development will be
                  crucial for realizing this potential.
