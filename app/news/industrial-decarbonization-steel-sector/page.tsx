                <h2>Nigeria's Steel Industry: Current State and Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                  Nigeria's steel industry, while still developing compared to global leaders, plays a crucial role in
                  the country's industrialization agenda. The sector currently produces approximately 1.3 million tonnes
                  of crude steel annually, far below the country's consumption needs of over 5 million tonnes. This
                  presents both a challenge and an opportunity - as Nigeria scales up its steel production capacity, it
                  has the chance to leapfrog to cleaner technologies from the outset.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The steel industry is inherently carbon-intensive, typically accounting for 7-9% of global CO2
                  emissions. In Nigeria, the sector's emissions profile is dominated by the use of coal and coke in
                  traditional blast furnace operations. As the country pursues its net-zero commitments, decarbonizing
                  the steel sector becomes essential for achieving national climate goals.
                </p>

                <h2>Decarbonization Pathways Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                  Our comprehensive analysis identifies four primary pathways for decarbonizing Nigeria's steel sector,
                  each with distinct technological, economic, and implementation characteristics:

                  Success will require coordinated action from government, industry, and international partners. The

                  benefits while contributing to global climate goals.
