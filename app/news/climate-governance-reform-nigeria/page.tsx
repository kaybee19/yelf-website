                <h2>The Governance Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                  Nigeria's climate governance landscape is characterized by fragmented institutional arrangements,
                  overlapping mandates, and insufficient coordination mechanisms. Despite having committed to ambitious
                  climate targets, including net-zero emissions by 2060 and updated Nationally Determined Contributions
                  (NDCs), the country's institutional framework remains inadequate for effective climate action
                  implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This policy brief, developed by YCTF's Governance Programme, presents comprehensive recommendations
                  for reforming Nigeria's climate governance structures. Our analysis reveals that effective climate
                  action requires not just policy commitments, but robust institutional frameworks that can coordinate
                  action across multiple levels of government and sectors of the economy.
                </p>

                <h2>Current Institutional Landscape</h2>
                <p>
                  Nigeria's climate governance involves multiple institutions across federal, state, and local levels:
                </p>

                <h3>Federal Level Institutions</h3>
                <ul>

                <p>
                  Effective climate governance is fundamental to Nigeria's ability to meet its climate commitments and
                  build a sustainable future. The reforms outlined in this brief provide a comprehensive roadmap for
                  strengthening institutional frameworks, improving coordination, and ensuring accountability in climate
                  action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Implementation of these recommendations will require political will, adequate resources, and sustained
                  commitment from all levels of government. However, the benefits - in terms of improved climate
                  outcomes, better policy coordination, and enhanced public trust - far outweigh the costs.
